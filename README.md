# Lease-Miles-Calculated
**I created this program for fun, it calculates the amount of miles that you are over or under in your lease** 
---
## If you have your own lease you need to edit a few things: 
- Change the purchased date to the date you purchased your lease. 
- If the amount of miles you get a year is different than the standard of 12,000:
    You will need to calculate the miles by take the yearly amount and devide by 365.
- Then Change add that number to the variable miles_a_day.
